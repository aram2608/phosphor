As of right now, this is simply a toy project and is mainly to help me learn C++.
Currently, text is handled using raw strings, and I am hoping to switch to a gap
buffer with line indexing once I have a better understanding of how they work
and how to implement them.

The text editor is completely functional, believe it or not, or at least somewhat.
File contents are loaded properly, and empty/non-existent files are handled properly
as well.

Here is a little demo demonstrating what the editor currently looks like and what
it can accomplish.

I am hoping to continue working on this passively as I get better with C++, if you
have any suggestions/comments that would be great!
